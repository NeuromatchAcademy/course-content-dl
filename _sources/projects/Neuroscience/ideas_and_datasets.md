# Ideas

Different categories of DL projects (in order of increasing expertise):
1. As an analysis toolkit to solve a problem
2. As a model of Brain or Behavior
3. Making Deep Learning pipeline more efficient / Understanding why a DL framework works (Conceptual Question). Can we make neural networks more like the brain?

## Brain-Score

[About Brainscore](https://paperswithcode.com/dataset/brain-score), [Main Website](http://www.brain-score.org/), [Tutorial](https://brain-score.readthedocs.io/en/latest/index.html), [preprint](https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/407007v2).

Overview: contains some datasets about behaviour and neural activity during image recognition tasks, as well as tools to compare similarity of ANN models to neural/behavioural data.
Potential research goals: comparing ANN activity and neural activity during image recognition. (*also need to look deeper at what datasets are available, might include more things). How does model architecture, learning rules influence similarity & performance?

Very preliminary [colab](https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1KUkwsbjDwLlmuoD3lPzmgTY1cYtSDpzR?usp=sharing).

## Allen Brain Observatory

The Allen Brain Observatory contains several relevant datasets.

[Older 2p data](http://observatory.brain-map.org/visualcoding/stimulus/natural_movies) with natural movie presentations

Very recent 2p data with behavior from NMA-CN: [Pre-processed subsample](https://colab.research.google.com/github/NeuromatchAcademy/course-content/blob/master/projects/neurons/load_Allen_Visual_Behavior_from_pre_processed_file.ipynb); [Entire dataset (SDK)](https://colab.research.google.com/github/NeuromatchAcademy/course-content/blob/master/projects/neurons/load_Allen_Visual_Behavior_from_SDK.ipynb); [Getting started](https://allensdk.readthedocs.io/en/latest/visual_behavior_optical_physiology.html); A short description of the dataset can be watched [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3YP-GYvYnuA).

[Neuropixels data](https://allensdk.readthedocs.io/en/latest/visual_coding_neuropixels.html) with [cheat sheet](https://brainmapportal-live-4cc80a57cd6e400d854-f7fdcae.divio-media.net/filer_public/0f/5d/0f5d22c9-f8f6-428c-9f7a-2983631e72b4/neuropixels_cheat_sheet_nov_2019.pdf
). [Basic colab](https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1TPkgSzIPdyrAnQBAqZK9x7baYK6WvskK?usp=sharing) for fetching and parsing Allen Neuropixels dataset (very rudimentary right now).

## BCIAUT-P300
[Reference paper](https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnins.2020.568104/full), [Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/disbeat/bciaut-p300)
