        "Train a deep network that can predict the locations of parts of animals. This Colab Notebook has all the code necessary to train a UNet network to predict the positions of 17 parts on a fruit fly. \n",
        "\n",
        "**Project ideas:**\n",
        "\n",
        "1. (easy-medium) Improve the pose estimator. Some possible ideas to explore:\n",
        "  * (easy) Data augmentation: It is common to train a network to be robust to certain kinds of perturbations by adding random perturbations to the training data. Try modifying the COCODataset to perform data augmentation. The mmpose toolkit has some data transforms relevant for pose tracking here\n",
        "https://github.com/open-mmlab/mmpose/blob/b0acfc423da672e61db75e00df9da106b6ead574/mmpose/datasets/pipelines/top_down_transform.py\n",
        "  * (medium) Network architecture: There are tons of networks people have designed for pose estimation. The mmpose toolbox has many networks implemented: \n",
        "https://github.com/open-mmlab/mmpose. Can you improve the accuracy with more exotic networks than the UNet? To do this, you should define a new network class, similar to the definition of [UNet](https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1SLgOHcgo1bfMDx5wlnLqm05AZe6aVG0l?authuser=1#scrollTo=Yf4vdxN7v9Rz&line=5&uniqifier=1). If you need a different loss function, you will also need to change the criterion used for training. \n",
        "  * (easy to medium) Optimization algorithm: Feed-forward convolutional networks have been engineered (e.g. by adding batch normalization layers) to be pretty robust to the exact choice of gradient descent algorithm, but there is still room for improvement in this code. \n",
        "  * Other ideas? Look at the errors the network is making -- how might we improve the tracker? \n",
        "  * (medium) Our training data set was relatively large -- 4216 examples. Can we get away with less examples than this? Can we change our algorithm to work better with smaller data sets? One idea to look into is pre-training the network on a different data set. \n",
        "  * Note: The data provided consists of both a training and a test set. It is important to not overfit to the test set, and only use it for a final evaluation. This code splits the training set into a training and a validation data set. Use this split data for testing out different algorithms. Then, after you finish developing your algorithm you can evaluate it on the test data. \n",
        "2. (easy) Train a pose estimator for a different data set. \n",
        "  * This Notebook has code for training a fly part tracker. More animal pose data sets can be found here: https://mmpose.readthedocs.io/en/latest/tasks/2d_animal_keypoint.html\n",
        "  * You can label your own dataset using animal tracking software like \n",
        "  DeepLabCut http://www.mackenziemathislab.org/deeplabcut\n",
        "  or APT http://kristinbranson.github.io/APT/\n",
        "  * To use a different data set, you might need to make a new Dataset class similar to our COCODataset class. \n",
        "3. (medium) Explore how well the network generalizes to data collected in other labs. Can you train a pose estimator that works on lots of different types of data? \n",
        "3. (easy) Explore using tensorboard with this network. Tensorboard lets you monitor and visualize training, and is an important tool as you develop and debug algorithms. A tutorial on using Tensorboard is here\n",
        "https://pytorch.org/tutorials/intermediate/tensorboard_tutorial.html\n",
        "A Colab Notebook using tensorboard is here:\n",
        "https://colab.research.google.com/github/pytorch/tutorials/blob/gh-pages/_downloads/tensorboard_with_pytorch.ipynb\n",
