    "### Writing the abstract of a modeling paper\n",
    "Abstracts are very stereotyped pieces of writing that contain highly condensed information. To write a summary (= abstract) of your modeling, you can use these questions as a guide:\n",
    "* **What is the phenomena**?  Here summarize the part of the phenomena which your modeling addresses.\n",
    "* **What is the key scientific question?**:  Clearly articulate the question which your modeling tries to answer.\n",
    "* **What was our hypothesis?**:  Explain the key relationships which we relied on to simulate the phenomena.\n",
    "* **How did your modeling work?** Give an overview of the model, it's main components, and how the modeling works.  ''Here we ... ''\n",
    "* **What did you find? Did the modeling work?** Explain the key outcomes of your modeling evaluation.\n",
    "* **What can you conclude?** Conclude as much as you can _with reference to the hypothesis_, within the limits of the modeling.  \n",
    "* **What are the limitations and future directions?** What is left to be learned? Briefly argue the plausibility of the approach and/or what you think is essential that may have been left out.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "**Instructions**: write down your answer to each of those questions (1-2 sentences each, max!). When you're done, stick the sentences together... Now you have an abstract!\n",
    "\n",
    "### Guidance for paper writing\n",
    "There are good guidelines for structuring and writing an effective paper (e.g., [Mensh & Kording, 2017](https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1005619)), all of which apply to papers about models. There are some extra considerations when publishing a model. In general, you should explain each of the steps in the paper:\n",
    "\n",
    "**Introduction:** Steps 1 & 2 (maybe 3)\n",
    "\n",
    "**Methods:** Steps 3-7, 9\n",
    "\n",
    "**Results:** Steps 8 & 9, going back to 1, 2 & 4\n",
    "\n",
    "Here are some great materials to help you with paper writing:\n",
    "* [Ten Simple Rules for Better Figures](https://journals.plos.org/ploscompbiol/article?id=10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003833)\n",
    "* [How to Write Strong and Effective Figure Legends](https://wordvice.com/how-to-write-effective-figure-titles-and-legends/)\n",
    "* [How to Create a Consistent Writing Schedule: 10 Tips for Writers](https://www.masterclass.com/articles/how-to-create-a-consistent-writing-schedule)\n",
    "\n",
    "In addition, you should provide a visualization of the model, and upload the code implementing the model and the data it was trained and tested on to a repository (e.g. GitHub and OSF).\n",
    "\n",
    "### Suggestion\n",
    "\n",
    "For every modeling project, a very good exercise is to _**first**_ write a short, 100-word abstract of the project plan and expected impact. This forces focussing on the main points: describing the relevance, question, model, answer and what it all means very succinctly. This allows you to decide to do this project or not **before you commit time writing code for no good purpose**. Notice that this is really what we've walked you through carefully in this guide! 😀\n"
