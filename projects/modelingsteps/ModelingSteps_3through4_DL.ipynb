Based on that, our algorithm needs to make a decision: was there self motion or not? This is a classical 2-choice classification problem. We will have to transform the raw spike data into the right input for the algorithm (spike pre-processing).\n\nSo we determined that we probably needed the following ingredients:\n\n* spike trains *S* of 3-second trials (10ms spike bins)\n* ground truth movement *m<sub>r</sub>* (real) and perceived movement *m<sub>p</sub>*\n* some form of classifier *C* giving us a classification *c*\n* spike pre-processing\n</font>\n"

The data was in an exponential map format, which has 3 rotations/angles for each joint (pitch, yaw, roll). The advantage of this type of data is that it is (mostly) agnostic about body size or shape. And since we care about movements only, we choose this representation of the data (there are other representations in the full data set).\n\nSince the joints are simply points, the 3rd angle (i.e. roll) contained no information, and that is already dropped from the data that we pre-formatted for this demo project. That is, the movements of each joint are described by 2 angles, that change over time. Furthermore, we normalized all the angles/rotations to fall between 0 and 1 so they are good input for PyTorch.\n\nFinally, the movements originally took various amounts of time, but we need the same input for each movement, so we sub-sampled and (linearly) interpolated the data to have 75 timepoints.\n\nOur training data is supposed to have 1032 movements, 2 x 24 joints = 48 channels and 75 timepoints.

These are related to our research questions and hypotheses, so this project will explicitly investigate which joints are most informative.\n\nFeature grouping? --> Instead of trying all possible combinations of joints (very many) we could focus on limbs, by grouping joints. We could also try the model on individual joints.\n\nClassifier? --> For our classifier we would like to keep it as simple as possible, but we will decide later.\n\nInput? --> The training data (movements and labels) will be used to train the classifier.\n\nOutput? --> The test data will be used as input for the trained model and we will see if the predicted labels are the same as the actual labels.\n\n</font>\n"

The noise idea also means that when the signal-to-noise ratio is higher, the brain does better, and this would be in the faster acceleration condition. We want to test this too.\n\nWe came up with the following hypotheses focussing on specific details of our overall research question:\n\n* Hyp 1: Accumulated vestibular spike rates explain self-motion judgements better than average spike rates around peak acceleration.\n* Hyp 2: Classification performance should be better for faster vs slower self-motion.\n\n> There are many other hypotheses you could come up with, but for simplicity, let's go with those.\n\nMathematically, we can write our hypotheses as follows (using our above ingredients):\n* Hyp 1: **E**(c<sub>accum</sub>) > **E**(c<sub>win</sub>)\n* Hyp 2: **E**(c<sub>fast</sub>) > **E**(c<sub>slow</sub>)\n\nWhere **E** denotes taking the expected value (in this case the mean) of its argument: classification outcome in a given trial type.\n</font>\n"
