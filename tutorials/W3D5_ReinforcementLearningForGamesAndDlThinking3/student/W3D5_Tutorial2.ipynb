In brief, it outlines an argument that most AI focuses on *retrospective learning*, where it uses past experiences to learn and make predictions in the future, assuming the future mimics the past.

They articulate four revelant factors that jointly define prospective learning: \"**Continual learning** enables intelligences to remember those aspects of the past which\n",

    "Paper 1: Neural sequence models, especially transformers, exhibit a remarkable capacity for in-context learning. The authors investigate the hypothesis that transformer-based in-context learners implement standard learning algorithms implicitly, by encoding smaller models in their activations, and updating these implicit models as new examples appear in the context.\n",

    "Paper 2: Large pretrained language models possess impressive In-Context Learning (ICL) capabilities, enabling them to predict labels for unseen inputs with just a few demonstration input-label pairs and without additional parameter updates. However, the underlying mechanism of ICL remains unknown. This paper views language models as meta-optimizers and conceptualizes ICL as a form of implicit finetuning, uncovering that Transformer attention follows a dual form of gradient descent optimization. Experimental comparisons confirm that ICL performs similarly to explicit finetuning in terms of prediction, representation, and attention behavior, and the introduction of momentum-based attention, inspired by meta-optimization, demonstrates its potential for future model design.\n",

    "\n",
    "Paper 1: While modern machine learning has been successful in modeling complex data, it has largely overlooked the use of logical flow control and external memory, despite their importance in computer programs. Recurrent neural networks (RNNs) have the ability to carry out intricate data transformations over extended periods and are Turing-Complete, capable of simulating arbitrary procedures. To simplify the solution of algorithmic tasks, the authors introduce the Neural Turing Machine (NTM), which enriches standard recurrent networks with a large, addressable memory, resembling human working memory and utilizing an attentional process for selective reading and writing. The NTM can be trained through gradient descent, making it a practical mechanism for learning programs.\n",
    "\n",
    "Paper 2: Deep reinforcement learning (RL) algorithms have seen great advancements by utilizing deep neural networks (DNNs), but they suffer from sample inefficiency. To address this, the authors propose Episodic Memory Deep Q-Networks (EMDQN), a biologically inspired RL algorithm that uses episodic memory for training supervision. Experimental results demonstrate that EMDQN achieves better sample efficiency, outperforming regular DQN and other episodic memory based RL algorithms, requiring only 1/5 of the interactions of DQN to achieve state-of-the-art performance on Atari games.\n",
    "Paper 3: Existing memory-augmented deep neural networks face limitations in lifelong and one-shot learning, particularly in remembering rare events. To address this, the authors introduce a large-scale lifelong memory module that utilizes fast nearest-neighbor algorithms for efficiency and scalability. The module is fully differentiable, trained end-to-end without additional supervision, and can be seamlessly integrated into various neural network architectures. Experimental results demonstrate the module's ability to achieve state-of-the-art performance in one-shot learning tasks on the Omniglot dataset and enable lifelong one-shot learning in recurrent neural networks for large-scale machine translation.\n",
