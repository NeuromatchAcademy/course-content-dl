The answer is that while our encoder was responsible for embedding words into a high-dimensional space, our tokenizer is NOT; the \"win\" of a tokenizer is that it breaks up a string into in-vocab elements. For certain workflows, the very next step might be adding an embedder onto the end of the tokenizer. (As we'll soon see, this is exactly the strategy employed by modern Transformer models.)\n",

    "for “in”, “ing”, “tion”, etc., the tokenizer can merge them into a single token\n",
    "that represents a common suffix.\n",
    "* Capture some semantic and syntactic information about the words, since the\n",
    "subword units are derived from the data and reflect how words are composed and\n",
