In other words, for a minibatch of $n$ sequence examples, each row of $X_t$  corresponds to one example at time step $t$ from the sequence. Next, we denote by $H_t \\in R^{nxh}$ the hidden variable of time step $t$. Unlike the MLP, here we save the hidden variable $H_{t-1}$ from the previous time step and introduce a new weight parameter $W_{hh} \\in R^{hxh}$ to describe how to use the hidden variable of the previous time step in the current time step. Specifically, the calculation of the hidden variable of the current time step is determined by the input of the current time step together with the hidden variable of the previous time step:\n",

It is worth mentioning that even at different time steps, RNNs always use these model parameters. Therefore, the parameterization cost of an RNN does not grow as the number of time steps increases.\n",

    "The GRU architecture looks very similar to the LSTM, and is often used as an alternative to the traditional LSTM. It also contains some variations that reduce it's complexity. For example, it combines the forget and input gates into a single “update gate”; it contains a \"hidden state\" but not a \"cell state\". In the next section we will be using GRUs as the choice of recurrent unit in our models, but you can always swap out the GRU for an LSTM later on (make sure that you take care of input and output dimensions in this case). Here is a description of the parts of the GRU:\n",

    "Previously, we designed an encoder-decoder architecture based on two RNNs for sequence to sequence learning. Specifically, the RNN encoder transforms a variable-length sequence into a fixed-shape context variable, then the RNN decoder generates the output (target) sequence token by token based on the generated tokens and the context variable. However, even though not all the input (source) tokens are useful for decoding a certain token, the same context variable that encodes the entire input sequence is still used at each decoding step. It is challenging for the models to deal with long sentences. \n",

    "In [Bahdanau et al., 2014](https://arxiv.org/abs/1409.0473), the authors proposed a technique called attention. When predicting a token, if not all the input tokens are relevant, the model aligns (or attends) only to parts of the input sequence that are relevant to the current prediction. \n"

    "Until now, we looked at attention aimed at seq2seq networks. Let’s try implementing attention for the above IMDB sentiment analysis dataset. Previously, using the LSTM, the classification completely depended on the last hidden state. In this exercise, we will compute the attention scores between the last hidden state and output of each sequence. The final attention vector will be the weighted average of the outputs at each sequence, with the weights being the attention scores. Lastly, we will concatenate the attention vector and the last hidden state to get the final output.\n",
