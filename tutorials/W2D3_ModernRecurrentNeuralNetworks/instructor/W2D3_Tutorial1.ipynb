    "Words or subword units such as morphemes are the basic units that we use to express meaning  in language. The technique of mapping words to vectors of real numbers is known as word embedding. \n",
    "\n",
    "Word2vec is based on theories of distributional semantics - words that appear around each other are more likely to mean similar things than words that do not appear around each other. Keeping this in mind, our job is to create a high dimensional space where these semantic relations are preserved. The innovation in word2vec is the realisation that we can use unlabelled, running text in sentences as inputs for a supervised learning algorithm--as a self-supervision task. It is supervised because we use the words in a sentence to serve as positive and negative examples. Let’s break this down:\n",
    "\n",
    "... \"use the kitchen knife to chop the vegetables\"…\n",
    "\n",
    "**C1   C2   C3   T   C4   C5   C6   C7**\n",
    "\n",
    "Here, the target word is knife, and the context words are the ones in its immediate (6-word) window. \n",
    "The first word2vec method we’ll see is called skipgram, where the task is to assign a probability for how likely it is that the context window appears around the target word. In the training process, positive examples are samples of words and their context words, and negative examples are created by sampling from pairs of words that do not appear nearby one another. \n",
    "\n",
    "This method of implementing word2vec is called skipgram with negative sampling. So while the algorithm tries to better learn which context words are likely to appear around a target word, it ends up pushing the embedded representations for every word so that they are located optimally (e.g., with minimal semantic distortion). In this process of adjusting embedding values, the algorithm brings semantically similar words close together in the resulting high dimensional space, and dissimilar words far away. \n",
    "\n",
    "Another word2vec training method, Continuous Bag of Words (CBOW), works in a similar fashion, and tries to predict the target word, given context. This is converse of skipgram, which tries to predict the context, given the target word. Skip-gram represents rare words and phrases well, often requiring more data for stable representations, while CBOW is several times faster to train than the skip-gram, but with slightly better accuracy for the frequent words in its prediction task. The popular gensim implementation of word2vec has both the methods included."

Here, we will use `tSNE` from [`scikit-learn`](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/generated/sklearn.manifold.TSNE.html) module to project our high dimensional embeddings in the 2D space (if you are not familiar with this method, think about `PCA`).\n",

One such method is FastText, developed at Facebook AI research, which breaks words into sub-words: such a technique also allows us to create embedding representations for unseen words. In this section, we will explore how semantics and meaning are captured using embedidngs, after downloading a pre-trained FastText model. Downloading pre-trained models is a way for us to plug in word embeddings and explore them without training them ourselves."

    "\n",
    "In this tutorial, we explored two different concepts linked to sequences, and text in particular, that will be the conceptual foundation for Recurrent Neural Networks.\n",
    "\n",
    "The first concept was that of sequences and probabilities. We saw how we can model language as sequences of text, and use this analogy to generate text. Such a setup is also used to classify text or identify parts of speech. We can either build chains manually using simple python and numerical computation, or use a package such as ```hmmlearn``` that allows us to train models a lot easier. These notions of sequences and probabilities (i.e, creating language models!) are key to the internals of a recurrent neural network as well. \n",

    "The second concept is that of word embeddings, now a mainstay of natural language processing. By using a neural network to predict context of words, these neural networks learn internal representions of words that are a decent approximation of semantic meaning (i.e embeddings!). We saw how these embeddings can be visualised, as well as how they capture meaning. We finally saw how they can be integrated into neural networks to better classify text documents."
